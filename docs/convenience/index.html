<h1 id="convenience-high-fidelity">Convenience &amp; high fidelity</h1>

<p>I read a book a while back called Trade-offs. The central premise was that the way people experience products or services can be mapped on a chart called the fidelity swap which showcases Fidelity on the Y axis and Convenience on the X axis.</p>

<p>In the context of this chart, fidelity refers to the *total experience of something *whereas** <strong>convenience</strong> **refers to how easy or hard is it to get what you want (It encompass availability, price, ease of use).</p>

<p>For instance, a high-fidelity way of listening to music could be to watch a live concert (you get the emotions of a fully live experience), while a more convenient way could just be to turn on a radio station (it‚Äôs cheap, easy..).</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PgbfGwicLLVPyvEykZz4UA.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the book, the author makes the point that the best companies often seem to be extremely good on one of the axis but that trying to be good on both axis is a hopeless endeavor: that more widely and easily accessible product will lose their scarcity, a necessary component of a ‚Äúhigh fidelity‚Äù experience:</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúA big part of fidelity is derived from a product‚Äôs aura and identity, [‚Ä¶] convenience acts likes antimatter to aura and identity. The more convenient something becomes ‚Äî the easier it is to get and buy ‚Äî the more aura and allure dissipate.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>This is a discussable argument. While it may seem true from a purely semantic perspective that if high fidelity experiences are defined by an above average quality, making them universally accessible mechanically renders them average, no longer *above average, *I believe it misses the point.</p>

<p>The qualitative aspect of a product is not a direct function of how widely distributed a product is, but rather the difference of an individual customer expectations with the product itself. High fidelity products match or exceed customer expectations.</p>

<p>The question then is whether individual expectations are influenced by how broadly products or services are available (scarcity), as argued by the author. In some industries, like luxury goods or fashion, they indeed are.</p>

<p>But in others, the picture is not that simple. People are happy to buy the same 800$ iPhone as everyone else, and it is the best phone on the market and still seem to be considered as such.</p>

<p>Uber is both a more convenient and high-fidelity experience than a taxi. Does the fact that Uber is now ubiquitous &amp; highly convenient weakens that fact ? not at all.</p>

<p>On the fidelity swap chart, the spot where a company has both a more convenient and high fidelity product or service to offer is called the <strong>fidelity mirage</strong>, because, according to the author, it does not exist.</p>

<p>I believe on the contrary that it does, except the way to get there is not straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="the-missing-component">The missing component</h3>

<p>The thing companies should be looking after is how fast customer expectations change. I believe the missing component of the trade-off model it the fact that mainstream customer‚Äôs expectations evolve more slowly than companies, especially technology-driven companies.</p>

<p>In an ideal fidelity-swap-driven world, customer‚Äôs expectation would move side by side with innovation, as a consequence companies would always need to be pushing hard on their current axis to make sure they stay on top of their customer‚Äôs needs and competitors.</p>

<p>The reality, tough, is different. Of course a minority of people are always eager for companies to push the envelope on their current path (I am), but anyone familiar with the famous technology adoption lifecycle model knows that those people, innovators and early adopters are not the ones who makes up a business.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tzxge6mZWXFrEIlQQ2SUoQ.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mainstream customers like to wait a bit before adopting new technologies, this phenomenon even has a name, it‚Äôs called the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123">**chasm</a>.**</p>

<p><strong>But how does this relate to our fidelity swap ?</strong></p>

<h3 id="growth-opportunities">Growth opportunities</h3>

<p>Technology driven companies are often quickly able to create either hyper convenient or high fidelity product experiences, but once there, they often find that mainstream customer‚Äôs expectations did not necessarily move up their chosen axis as fast.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the way for those companies to keep delivering value to their customers is often <strong>not only to keep pushing on their current axis, as the trade-off model argues they should, but also to enlarge their competitive edge onto the opposite axis.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tRLDFkQNVJqTJscrBhrgMA.png" alt="**Companies should focus on one of the axis, convenience or fidelity, until they become well above average by fully satisfying their customer‚Äôs expectations and by beating their competitors on this particular axis, only then can they start deviating onto the other axis.**" /><strong><em>Companies should focus on one of the axis, convenience or fidelity, until they become well above average by fully satisfying their customer‚Äôs expectations and by beating their competitors on this particular axis, only then can they start deviating onto the other axis.</em></strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs a move for companies that have already achieved a certain threshold of success. Moreover the deviation means that the company needs ressources to both maintain its leader position on its original axis while pushing on the new one.</p>

<h3 id="a-few-examples">A few examples</h3>

<p><strong>Amazon:</strong></p>

<p>Amazon is the incarnation of the ultimate convenient service. Buy nearly anything in 30 seconds without leaving your sofa and get delivered in two days. It became successful with that strategy and is still on the edge in terms of convenience and efficiency.</p>

<p>But when you look at where Amazon is trying to deliver novel value to its customers, it increasingly look like it‚Äôs trying to deliver high fidelity, Amazon branded products and services: Echo, Prime Music, the Fire tablets and TV, Amazon video.</p>

<p><strong>Netflix</strong>:</p>

<p>Netflix became successful by solving a convenience problem. Renting (at the time physical) DVDs was a painful process that involved going to the DVD rental shop before and after watching the movie. Netflix solved that problem first through a DVD-by-mail system, then by an on-demand streaming service. It became, and still is, the most convenient service to watch movies or series.</p>

<p>However Netflix strategy has shifted toward creating a higher fidelity experience through original content like series and feature films. While most of Netflix‚Äôs competitors are still trying to catch up on the convenience axis.</p>

<p><strong>Uber:</strong></p>

<p>Uber started as a high fidelity experience, the idea was ‚Äòget a limo ride at the press of a button‚Äô. The vision at the beginning was all about how to be a ‚Äúballer in San Fransisco‚Äù (actual quote from the founder) more than an hyper efficient and convenient way to get around cities. Except that on their own <em>fidelity</em> axis, the current customer expectations were quite low due to the mediocre quality of alternative services, namely, Taxis.</p>

<p>They quickly shifted toward making the most convenient, reliable and affordable service possible through UberX, UberPool as well as well as their worldwide network of drivers.</p>

<p>One could argue that convenience was already built into the idea (the ‚Äúpress of a button‚Äù part). Real convenience, in Uber‚Äôs case, was to be able to build a driver network that would allow people to get a reliable car anywhere, anytime, which is was bigger challenge than simply building an app that calls a car.</p>

<p><strong>The luxury industry:</strong></p>

<p>Boucheron, Cartier.. The strategy of the luxury industry these last two decades has been the following: win the hearts mind of customers through branding and history, push the enveloppe on the high-fidelity experience, but ultimately make their profits on accessible branded items (perfumes, accessible jewelry), sold in malls and touristic destinations.</p>
