<h1 id="the-perception-of-design-2016">The Perception of Design (2016)</h1>

<p>When I started designing website mockups for my first company, Showmade, I had no significant design experience. Looking back on those and the early versions of the website, I realize they really sucked.</p>

<p>But back when I made those, I thought they were good. Maybe this was just another instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Most likely my perception and understanding of good design was too narrow to appreciate what was bad about them.</p>

<p>Tony Fadell did a great TED talk a few months ago where he said that the first secret of design is noticing. What he meant is that humans tend to get used to the way things are, we look at the big picture, not the details</p>

<p>The role of the designer though, is to shape this big picture by taking care of those little details.</p>

<p><strong>People can perceive details until a point. They can characterize why they like one interface or product more than the other until an inflection point where the perception of the whole takes over and they are no longer able to tell why a design is better. They just feel it.</strong></p>

<p>We all have this inflection point and it seems that the better the designer, the farthest away the point is. Because the magic of designing great products happens within the difference of a user’s point and the designer’s inflection point.</p>

<p>It’s within this difference that the designer has the most leverage to take action on small things that users probably won’t ever notice but will make together a difference on the perception of the product as a whole.</p>

<p>That’s probably one of the reason why articulating design choices can be hard.
Designers make decisions that have passed other people’s inflection point, often at the edge of their own perception.</p>

<p>Some design decisions are unequivocal while others are the fruit of subjective feelings and gut. That’s where you know you are reaching that perception boundary.</p>

<p>It doesn’t necessary mean you’ll make bad decisions, some people have good instincts, it means however that you reach a point where there is less clarity over why you make a decision. A clarity that a better designer (or a more experienced version of yourself) could possibly bring.</p>

<p>Looking back on the early versions of the website, I can now easily tell why they sucked. Yet the design struggle is not gone for good, it’s only my perception’s boundary that has moved.</p>
