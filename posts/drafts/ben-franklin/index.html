<p>I just got around finishing Benjamin Franklin&rsquo;s biography by Walter Isaacson. I read it to understand why his character has been a source of fascination and admiration for many, and while the book was dense and at times a bit longish, by the end I definitely shared a form of admiration for the man (as I tend to do for all polymaths).</p>

<p>Here is a list of things I learned about Benjamin Franklin.</p>

<h3 id="1-printer">1. Printer</h3>

<p>He started as a printer in Philadelphia and even though he had multiple lives, as a publisher, post master, scientist and politician, he kept referring to himself as a printer for all his life.</p>

<h3 id="2-publisher">2. Publisher</h3>

<p>Ben Franklin started working in his brother&rsquo;s printing shop, which was at that time publishing a journal called the New English Courant. His brother didn&rsquo;t want Franklin to publish in the journal <strong>so he slipped novels written under a pseudonym, &ldquo;Mrs. Silence Dogwood&rdquo; under the printing shop door</strong>. The novels became increasingly successful, forcing him to reveal his identity.</p>

<h3 id="4-runaway">4. Runaway</h3>

<p>At 17, he ran away from his brother&rsquo;s shop and family with no money, traveling from Boston to New York then Philadelphia, where he found a job in another printing shop.</p>

<h3 id="3-self-improvement">3. Self-improvement</h3>

<p>Ben Franklin was the patron saint of self-improvement, spending time devising system of moral values and going so far as tracking his habits.</p>

<p>For instance, his &ldquo;Plan for future conduct&rdquo; included the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>It is necessary for me to be extremely frugal for some time, till I have paid what I owe.</li>
<li>To endeavour to speak truth in every instance; to give nobody expectations that are not likely to be answered, but aim at sincerity in every word and action—the most amiable excellence in a rational being.</li>
<li>To apply myself industriously to whatever business I take in hand, and not divert my mind from my business by any foolish project of growing suddenly rich; for industry and patience are the surest means of plenty.</li>
<li>I resolve to speak ill of no man whatever, not even in a matter of truth; but rather by some means excuse the faults I hear charged upon others, and upon proper occasions speak all the good I know of every body.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="3-communicator">3. Communicator</h3>

<p>He was a real expert at communication, which helped him
- appearing industrious
- auto biography
- clothings in France</p>

<h3 id="4-inventor">4. Inventor</h3>

<p>Practical inventions
Invented paratonnerre
Electricity
Invented the lunettes</p>

<h3 id="5-negotiator">5. Negotiator</h3>

<h3 id="7-edits-of-the-declaration-of-independence">7. Edits of the declaration of independence</h3>

<p>The declaration of independence was mostly written by Thomas Jefferson, though Franklin added one historical edit, replacing <em>sacred</em> by <em>self-evident</em> in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.</em></p>
