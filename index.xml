      <description>Is there room for a meta-level communication tool ? Companies have struggled with internal communication for as long as collaboration and creativity have become « important ». Information distribution in organization has evolved as management practices .. And except if you’re called Apple or Palantir, there is a good chance that overall transparency and free information distribution are link to more efficient collaboration, creativity, and as such highly valuable to business outcomes.</description>

      <description>Feedback delays : the surprising link between faucet design and Machine Learning. Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows is a great introduction to the discipline of system modeling and analysis. One of the chapters of the book explains how feedback delays in a system with balancing loops can cause systems to oscillate before stabilizing closer to their desired state.
I know this might sound like gibberish if you are foreign to system modeling, but this is actually a simple and powerful idea with many real-world application, one of which you’ve probably experienced yourself more than once.</description>

      <description>The Forces of Progress I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about the jobs to be done methodology lately. It’s a useful framework to get to the roots of customer needs.
The theory makes the points that to innovate, companies must take a step back from the first degree needs of their customers to understand the more fundamental progress they are trying to achieve. To do so, they must understand the « job » people hire their product to do.</description>

      <description>The third pillar of online education Why hasn’t internet replaced universities yet ? A few years ago, when platforms such as Coursera and Udacity popped up, the bullish vision for online education saw an inevitable long-term demise of the university system.
With online education, you would access world class education for free or for a fraction of what is usually cost.
